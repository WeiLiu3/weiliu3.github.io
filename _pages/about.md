*("薇" is a Chinese character referring to a small, resilient wild plant.)*

I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [Virginia Tech](https://www.vt.edu/), advised by [Dr. Chris North](https://people.cs.vt.edu/north/) and [Dr. Rebecca Faust](https://rjfaust.github.io/). My research focuses on creating interactive and explainable visual analytics systems for text data. I study how people interpret machine-learned text embeddings and design methods that make these representations more **explainable**, and **steerable**.

Broadly, I work in **Visual Analytics**, **Explainable AI**, and **Human–AI Collaboration**, with the goal of enabling analysts to better understand, explore, and guide AI-powered text analysis.
