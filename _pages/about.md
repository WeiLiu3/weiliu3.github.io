I am currently a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [Virginia Tech](https://www.vt.edu/), advised by [Dr. Chris North](https://people.cs.vt.edu/north/) and [Dr. Rebecca Faust](https://rjfaust.github.io/). My current work aims to design interactive visual analytics systems that can perform comprehensible analysis of text data powered by deep learning methods. My research interests lie in Visual Analytics, Explainable AI, and Human-AI Collaboration.
